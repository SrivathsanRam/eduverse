# Welcome to Eduverse!

Eduverse is a learning management system that keeps teachers in control of designing lesson plans and identifying links between topics. Teachers also control exactly what questions are shown to their students when creating assignments. Lastly, teachers also upload multimodal learning materials to aid students in actively revising while attempting questions.

```bash
